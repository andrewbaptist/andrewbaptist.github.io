A collection of useful links for a developer of object storage. 

This is not a definitive reference on the subject, and if you see resources that you think should be added to this page, please email me at [andrew.baptist@gmail.com](mailto:andrew.baptist@gmail.com) and I might add it.


S3 Libraries - this is typically how you will interact with object storage
[Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/)

S3 Object API - most developers won't care about using this directly, but still useful to have

* [Amazon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html) - has become the defacto, but rapidly changing, API
* [IBM](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/about-cos.html) - mostly an S3 compatible API
* [Google](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/) - mostly an S3 compatible API
* [Micrsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction) - not an S3 Object API, but fairly popular as well
* [Alibaba](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/31947.htm?spm=a2c63.p38356.b99.425.62a42234RMPxBj) - essentially S3, but changes the tags from amazon to oss
