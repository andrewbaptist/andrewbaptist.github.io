Andrew Baptist
--------------
I am Distinguished Engineer at IBM focused on Cloud Object Storage. I joined IBM through the [acquisition of Cleversafe](https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/48027.wss) in 2015. I am responsible for a number of storage innovations — including the Simple Object interface, and the creation of an extremely efficient storage engine called Zone Storage. I was also instrumental in most of Cleversafe’s largest and most complex client engagements and continue to work with hyperscale customers as they move to object storage. I am a Master Innovator with more than [200 patents](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=andrew+baptist) issued, and the chief architect for [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage).

I started this blog to answer the question "Why Object?" and more specifically to delve into the following 4 areas.

* Compare object storage to other storage technologies
* Provide examples of using object storage
* Detail the internals of IBM COS
* Project the future of object storage
