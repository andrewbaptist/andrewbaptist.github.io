Andrew Baptist is a Distinguished Engineer at IBM. He joined IBM through the [acquisition of Cleversafe](https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/48027.wss). He is responsible for a number of storage innovations — including the initial versions of “packed storage," which improved the performance of traditional file systems storing billions of small objects. Andrew was also instrumental in all of Cleversafe’s largest and most complex client engagements. He is a Master Innovator with more than [200 patents](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=andrew+baptist) issued, and is chief architect for [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage).

This site is intended to serve several purposes:

* Compare object storage to other storage technologies
* Provide examples of using object storage
* Detail the internals of IBM COS
* Project the future of object storage
